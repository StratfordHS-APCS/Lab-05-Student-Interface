# Lab 05 - Student Interface

## Lab Goal
In this lab you will be implementing an interface.  An interface is like a contract that defines the minimum of what methods need to be implemented in a class that implements the interface.  You will also be practicing good object-oriented design in constructing a class.

## Instructions
 * Modify `Student.java` and complete all of the methods defined in `StudentInterface.java`.
 * Modify `StudentRunner.java` to create more Students and test the methods.
 * Make sure you add a javadoc comment on each method.  You'll need to include a ```@param``` tag for each method that accepts a parameter.  Include a `@return` tag on any method that returns a value.

## Sample Output
```
George Castanza attends Vandalay University
Name = George Castanza
School = Vandalay University
Harry Potter attends Hogwarts Academy
Name = Harry Potter
School = Hogwarts Academy
George Castanza and Harry Potter attend different schools.
George Castanza transferred to Hogwarts Academy
George Castanza and Harry Potter attend the same school.
```

## Helpful Resources
 * [Classes (ThinkJava)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6012.html)
 * [Interfaces in Java (Geeks for Geeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-java/)

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.
* Edit the first line of the Readme.md file and put your username in both locations that say "username".  This is necessary if you want the badge at the top of the instructions to show red or green based on your most recent commit.

## Grading
* 90 - StudentInterface implemented correctly in Student class
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
